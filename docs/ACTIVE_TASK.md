# ACTIVE_TASK — simulation-backend

## Layer ID

F2-B (backend application foundations: simulation-backend, auditor-backend,
energy-ml-service). Agent B. Developer: Mohan.

## Objective

Scaffold this repository's application foundation against contract 1.0.1
(frozen, read-only during F2-B): health route(s) only, env config, formal
JSON Schema validation (Node repos), reproducible dependencies, verification,
docs, commit + push. No DB, simulation, uploads, interservice calls,
training or deployment. Stop after F2-B (no F3/F4).

## Task status

completed

## Review status

pending

## Ownership

- Agent B owns ONLY `simulation-backend`, `auditor-backend`,
  `energy-ml-service`. Agent A concurrently owns both frontends — do not
  write to, probe, or kill processes of the frontends; no parent-level files.
- Repository: `simulation-backend` — port 4000.

## Previous task outcome (preserved)

F1-R2 (contract 1.0.1) completed and pushed; accepted by the architecture
lead based on supplied evidence. Verifier 75/75 at F2-B start.

## Current branch

`main` at `f64ee215d4b3fc5021eadf8ec5eb7aeef290a024` (== origin/main after fetch; clean tree).

## Last checkpoint timestamp, including timezone

2026-09-24 19:39:10 +05:30 (IST) — F2-B implementation completed; committing + pushing.

## Applicable contract version

1.0.1 (implementation baseline; contracts/v1 + scripts/verify-contract.mjs read-only).

## Completed steps

1. Startup: no AGENTS.md; clean + in sync; ports free; baseline verifier 75/75.
2. Scaffold + pinned dependencies written (see docs/F2_B_EVIDENCE.md).
3. All checks green; live HTTP verification on the assigned port.
4. Windows Smart App Control blocked a pandas extension; Mohan changed the
   Windows setting; re-test passed.
5. README, HANDOFF (F2-B addendum), PROGRESS_LOG, F2_B_EVIDENCE updated.

## Files changed

Scaffold source/config/tests, dependency manifests (+lock/requirements), .env.example, .gitignore (`!.env.example`), README.md, docs/HANDOFF.md, docs/ACTIVE_TASK.md, docs/PROGRESS_LOG.md, docs/F2_B_EVIDENCE.md. contracts/v1 and scripts/verify-contract.mjs unchanged.

## Verification performed and actual results

verify:contract 75/75; validate:schema 24/24 (Ajv 8.20.0, 2020-12 strict); typecheck/lint/build exit 0; test 7/7; live GET http://localhost:4000/api/v1/health → 200 not_initialized envelope; 404 NOT_FOUND + 400 VALIDATION_ERROR envelopes live.

## Incomplete edits and uncommitted changes

None beyond the F2-B commit in progress.

## Blockers or unknowns

- None blocking. Contract ambiguities reported (not changed) in docs/F2_B_EVIDENCE.md.
- Graceful shutdown not exercised live (Windows hard-terminate used).

## Exact next action

Commit + push F2-B, verify remote hash, return F2-B evidence. Then STOP — F3 only when its prompt is assigned; no F4.

## Planned checks

verify:contract, validate:schema (Node), typecheck, lint, build, test,
live HTTP health + not-found checks on the assigned port (Node); interpreter,
imports, pip check, pytest, live uvicorn on 8000 (Python).

## Processes started by Agent B

Started for live checks (19:35 IST) and stopped: sim node 8184, auditor node 21296, python launcher 15116 → interpreter 9456. None left running; ports 4000/4001/8000 free.

## Commit reference

Base: `f64ee215d4b3fc5021eadf8ec5eb7aeef290a024`. F2-B: the commit containing this file (hash in the F2-B return report).
